Participant 1 — Design Analysis

AUDIENCE / USERS
- General gallery visitors without formal art backgrounds, often visiting with friends/partners.
- Value stories, technique, and “human touch” narration; enjoy dialogue and shared interpretation.
- Want immersion without disruption; open to tech if it enhances focus and social connection.

PROBLEM SPACE
- Context (audio stories, music, artist intent) turns viewing into felt experience.
- Social dynamics are mixed: dialogue with companions helps; noisy crowds break immersion.
- Physical constraints limit close inspection (can’t touch/lean in/zoom to see technique).
- Access models (e.g., free entry) diversify audiences but also increase distraction risk.

DESIGN GAPS
1) Depth beyond plaques: plaques are concise; visitors crave organic, empathetic narration in situ.
2) Social signal control: no way to tune what you hear from others; noise disrupts audio tours.
3) Close-looking limitations: lack of safe, detail-rich “zoom”/inspection affordances on site.
4) Multivocal meaning: no structured layer to integrate artist/curator/peer/visitor viewpoints live.

CORE GAP
How might we support meaningful, immersive, and socially balanced ways for visitors to connect with art and each other while overcoming disruptions and physical limits of the gallery space?

DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES
1) Human-centered narratives
   - Augment audio/AR with organic, empathetic storytelling; keep the “human touch” even if AI-assisted.
2) Controlled social layers
   - XR group “bubbles” to hear only your companions; noise filtering that preserves immersion.
3) Virtual extensions of the room
   - XR mirror of the gallery to safely zoom into brushwork, materials, technique, and composition.
4) Shared multivocal overlays
   - Layer artist intent, curator notes, peer interpretations, and live visitor reactions as opt‑in overlays.
