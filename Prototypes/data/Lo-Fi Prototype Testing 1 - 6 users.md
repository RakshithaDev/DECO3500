# User Testing Notes

## Idea 1: AI / Music Sharing

### User 1
- Wanted to share his name and music by clicking on the dot.  
- Chose to share only his part of the music, then selected to share on social media.  
- Found the **three options confusing**—thought it was about selecting a part of the music.  
- Would like to know more about what happens after pressing each button.  
- Layout of the three options caused confusion.  
- Clicking the dots shows feedback, but the interaction wasn’t clear.  

### User 2 (Music – Zhan’s Friend)
- Clock element was confusing.  
- Preferred having a **side menu** on screen.  
- Bottom selection was **totally confusing**.  
- Felt the interaction was not smooth and caused **cognitive overload**.  
- Suggested looking at other music case studies for references.  

### User 3 (Music – Yves)
- Prefers to listen to people with the same vibe.  
- Colored dots were confusing.  
- **Co-creation feature was unclear.**  

### User 4 (Music – Felicia)
- Chose to remain anonymous.  
- Mentioned a missing feature: allowing users to choose what they want to listen to.  
- Asked about lazy typing alternatives → we introduced the **generated prompt option**.  
- Clicked “same vibe” → only green dots played.  
- Still found **lazy typing** confusing.  
- Questioned: When contributing one note/line/theme, how is it interpreted?  
- Concern: If everyone shares a sad vibe, it could make the mood even sadder.  
- Mixing depends on AI → caused confusion.  
- Suggested: screen size should be bigger and catch people’s attention.

## Idea 2: AR Feedback on Artworks

### User 1
- Flow:  
  1. Takes a picture.  
  2. Adds his name.  
  3. Sees other people’s feedback using AR.  
- Some comments didn’t make sense → wanted to **post again asking for clarification**.  
- Didn’t understand how to take a photo at first (intro unclear).  
- Took a picture of the **artwork**, not himself.  
- After seeing comments, wanted to add his own comments.  

### User 2
- Initially said he wouldn’t try it.  
- Marked the idea as creative.  
- Shared as **anonymous**.  
- Confused about what to do next.  
- When AR pop-ups appeared → he liked and commented on some.  
- Liked seeing other people’s artworks.  
- Didn’t want to add his name (felt he’s not an art expert).  
- Appreciated the **anonymous option**.  
- Said idea was confusing at first, but made sense after use.  
- Suggested: ensure AR overlays don’t cover the artwork.  
- Preferred to:  
  1. Add his own feelings first.  
  2. See others’ feelings.  
  3. Add more comments again.  

### User 3 (AR – Kiichi)
- Compared it to a **messenger app** (adding picture, emoji, text).  
- Would click text input and type feelings anonymously.  
- AR space: liked like/comment/share interactions.  
- Concern: overlays covered parts of the artwork.  
- Suggested improvements:  
  - Add location to shared frames.  
  - Add more chat platform share options.  
  - Option to zoom into comments or artworks.  
  - Provide a list showing “most liked” comments.  
  - Artists could make their own posts.  
  - Could evolve into comic threads, quotes, or interpretations.  
- Felt interaction was intuitive and fluid.  
- Concern: elderly users may struggle with usability.  
- Would use this in a **museum/art gallery setting**.
