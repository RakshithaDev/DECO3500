Navigation for the AR Idea

Scan QR or open artwork page
→ Browser loads /ar?id=artX.

Prompt: Allow camera?
→ User is asked for camera access.

User denies permission
→ Selects No / Deny.

Overlay shown
→ “Camera access is needed for AR. You can continue in text mode.”

Fallback panel displayed
→ Placeholder panel with prompt: “What do you feel about this artwork? Type your thoughts below.”

User writes comment + taps Submit
→ Their thoughts are saved (local or backend).
→ Instead of showing a scrollable feed, they only see a confirmation like: “Thanks for sharing!”.

Option: Enable camera (persistent button)
→ If tapped, the system re-prompts for camera permission.

If camera permission now granted
→ User is switched into AR mode.
→ In AR, they can see comments (their own + others) anchored visually on the artwork itself, instead of in a text feed UI.
