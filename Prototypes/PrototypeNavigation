Navigation for the AR Idea

Flow A: Scan → AR

User scans QR → browser opens /ar?id=art1

Ask camera permission → on allow → AR scene loads

“Find ART1” hint → user points at artwork → comment panel appears

CTA: “Learn more”, “Audio guide”, or “Share” (optional)



Flow B: No QR → Browse

User opens home/landing → taps “Browse artworks”

Search/list → selects artwork → opens /ar?id=…

Same AR steps as Flow A



Flow C: Permission denied

Deny camera → show overlay with “Enable camera in Settings” + fallback “View 3D/Info” (non-AR)
