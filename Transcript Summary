Participant1 - Design Opportunity Identified:
Creating immersive VR experiences that allow users to experience an artist's creative process in real-time, rather than just viewing finished artworks
Combine visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to help visitors feel the artist's emotions
-Sophisticated interactive elements beyond basic visual/auditory feedback
-Facilitate meaningful dialogue between visitors about artworks
Help visitors identify and explore their emotional responses to art


Design Gap:
Current State: Art galleries offer primarily passive, individual experiences with limited interactivity (mostly for children), poor navigation, and minimal opportunities for emotional or social connection.
Desired State: Immersive, multi-sensory experiences that create deep emotional bridges between visitors and artists, while fostering meaningful social connections and clear guidance throughout the visit.
Core Gap: 
-Lack of sophisticated, adult-oriented systems that transform solitary art viewing into emotionally rich, socially connected experiences.
There's a disconnect between experiencing finished art and understanding how/why it was created

Audience:
Adult art gallery visitors who:
Visit galleries with family/friends
Seek emotional connections with artwork
Want to understand artists' intentions and emotions
Appreciate interactive experiences but find current options inadequate
Desire to share and hear diverse perspectives on art
Understand the emotional and creative journey behind artworks
Experience art beyond just visual observation
Connect more deeply with artists' creative processes



Participant 2 – Design Opportunity Identified:

-Enable visitors to easily share and hear diverse perspectives about the same artwork, encouraging dialogue and reflection.

-Create interactive, participatory installations (like sticker walls) that let visitors contribute collectively and sense others’ creativity and emotions.

-Provide guided but minimal context (artist name, theme/area) without overwhelming visitors with excessive details.

-Develop ways to capture and connect visitors’ emotions and personal experiences with the artwork.

-Support ongoing post-visit conversation beyond the gallery walls, so discussions don’t fade immediately after leaving.

Design Gap:

-Current State: Gallery visits are often passive, with limited structured opportunities for social exchange. Emotional connections mostly occur in participatory or playful zones (like sticker walls), but these are rare. Overly detailed descriptions overwhelm rather than engage. Conversations with friends about art are short-lived and quickly replaced by other topics.

-Desired State: Galleries that facilitate active, shared meaning-making through lightweight, creative, and conversational interactions. Visitors receive just enough context to orient themselves and then explore personal/emotional interpretations together.

Core Gap:

-Lack of systems for adult visitors to meaningfully and socially engage with art during and after the visit.

-Emotional engagement opportunities are limited to a few interactive corners rather than being woven throughout the gallery.

Audience:
Adult modern art gallery visitors who:

-Visit galleries socially (with friends/family) and want to exchange opinions.

-Value hearing diverse perspectives and reflecting on how emotions, age, gender, and experience shape interpretation.

-Appreciate hands-on participatory activities that foster shared creativity.

-Desire deeper emotional and social connections with artworks and co-visitors.




Participant 3
AUDIENCE / USERS
- General gallery visitors without formal art backgrounds, often visiting with friends/partners.
- Value stories, technique, and “human touch” narration; enjoy dialogue and shared interpretation.
- Want immersion without disruption; open to tech if it enhances focus and social connection.

PROBLEM SPACE
- Context (audio stories, music, artist intent) turns viewing into felt experience.
- Social dynamics are mixed: dialogue with companions helps; noisy crowds break immersion.
- Physical constraints limit close inspection (can’t touch/lean in/zoom to see technique).
- Access models (e.g., free entry) diversify audiences but also increase distraction risk.

DESIGN GAPS
1) Depth beyond plaques: plaques are concise; visitors crave organic, empathetic narration in situ.
2) Social signal control: no way to tune what you hear from others; noise disrupts audio tours.
3) Close-looking limitations: lack of safe, detail-rich “zoom”/inspection affordances on site.
4) Multivocal meaning: no structured layer to integrate artist/curator/peer/visitor viewpoints live.

CORE GAP
How might we support meaningful, immersive, and socially balanced ways for visitors to connect with art and each other while overcoming disruptions and physical limits of the gallery space?

DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES
1) Human-centered narratives
   - Augment audio/AR with organic, empathetic storytelling; keep the “human touch” even if AI-assisted.
2) Controlled social layers
   - XR group “bubbles” to hear only your companions; noise filtering that preserves immersion.
3) Virtual extensions of the room
   - XR mirror of the gallery to safely zoom into brushwork, materials, technique, and composition.
4) Shared multivocal overlays
   - Layer artist intent, curator notes, peer interpretations, and live visitor reactions as opt‑in overlays.



Participant 4
AUDIENCE / USERS
- Modern art gallery visitors who experience varied emotional responses (empathy vs. alienation).
- Often attend with companions; seek both personal meaning and social validation.

PROBLEM SPACE
- Emotion is unevenly triggered: narrative/atmosphere (e.g., exhibition on Aboriginal suffering) evokes empathy; abstract works feel inaccessible.
- Social sharing is ad hoc: overhearing or post-visit vlogs; little structured in‑situ sharing.
- Feelings stay private; opportunities for collective reflection are missed.

DESIGN GAPS
1) Lack of synchronous emotional sharing
   - In-gallery tools don’t let visitors sense each other’s changing emotions in real time.
2) Bridge to abstract art
   - No mechanism to reframe “I don’t get it” into curiosity via others’ perspectives/emotions.
3) Contextual scaffolding
   - Emotional resonance depends on exhibition design; there’s no dynamic, visitor-driven layer.

CORE GAP
How might we transform internal, often-isolated emotions into shared, situated, and co-created expressions inside galleries?

DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES
1) Emotion-to-media transformation
   - Use AI/AR/music to convert feelings into shareable artifacts (e.g., affect-driven AR visuals) anchored to artworks.
2) Synchronous emotion sharing
   - Biofeedback-driven experiences (heart-rate wearables, group “pulse” visualizations) for real-time resonance.
3) Social validation & collective meaning
   - Lightweight ways to capture/see diverse reactions in situ to reduce alienation with abstract works.
4) Curiosity pathways
   - Prompt re-interpretation of difficult pieces via co-created music, emotional overlays, or narrative snippets.
