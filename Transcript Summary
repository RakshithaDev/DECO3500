Participant1 - Design Opportunity Identified:
Creating immersive VR experiences that allow users to experience an artist's creative process in real-time, rather than just viewing finished artworks
Combine visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to help visitors feel the artist's emotions
-Sophisticated interactive elements beyond basic visual/auditory feedback
-Facilitate meaningful dialogue between visitors about artworks
Help visitors identify and explore their emotional responses to art


Design Gap:
Current State: Art galleries offer primarily passive, individual experiences with limited interactivity (mostly for children), poor navigation, and minimal opportunities for emotional or social connection.
Desired State: Immersive, multi-sensory experiences that create deep emotional bridges between visitors and artists, while fostering meaningful social connections and clear guidance throughout the visit.
Core Gap: 
-Lack of sophisticated, adult-oriented systems that transform solitary art viewing into emotionally rich, socially connected experiences.
There's a disconnect between experiencing finished art and understanding how/why it was created

Audience:
Adult art gallery visitors who:
Visit galleries with family/friends
Seek emotional connections with artwork
Want to understand artists' intentions and emotions
Appreciate interactive experiences but find current options inadequate
Desire to share and hear diverse perspectives on art
Understand the emotional and creative journey behind artworks
Experience art beyond just visual observation
Connect more deeply with artists' creative processes



Participant 2 – Design Opportunity Identified:

-Enable visitors to easily share and hear diverse perspectives about the same artwork, encouraging dialogue and reflection.

-Create interactive, participatory installations (like sticker walls) that let visitors contribute collectively and sense others’ creativity and emotions.

-Provide guided but minimal context (artist name, theme/area) without overwhelming visitors with excessive details.

-Develop ways to capture and connect visitors’ emotions and personal experiences with the artwork.

-Support ongoing post-visit conversation beyond the gallery walls, so discussions don’t fade immediately after leaving.

Design Gap:

-Current State: Gallery visits are often passive, with limited structured opportunities for social exchange. Emotional connections mostly occur in participatory or playful zones (like sticker walls), but these are rare. Overly detailed descriptions overwhelm rather than engage. Conversations with friends about art are short-lived and quickly replaced by other topics.

-Desired State: Galleries that facilitate active, shared meaning-making through lightweight, creative, and conversational interactions. Visitors receive just enough context to orient themselves and then explore personal/emotional interpretations together.

Core Gap:

-Lack of systems for adult visitors to meaningfully and socially engage with art during and after the visit.

-Emotional engagement opportunities are limited to a few interactive corners rather than being woven throughout the gallery.

Audience:
Adult modern art gallery visitors who:

-Visit galleries socially (with friends/family) and want to exchange opinions.

-Value hearing diverse perspectives and reflecting on how emotions, age, gender, and experience shape interpretation.

-Appreciate hands-on participatory activities that foster shared creativity.

-Desire deeper emotional and social connections with artworks and co-visitors.
