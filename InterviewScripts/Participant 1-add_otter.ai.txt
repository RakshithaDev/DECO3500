Oh, okay, I can think of one of the the way that people connect and share emotions is if I can be possibly immersed into the environment where the author creates that piece of art, that would be great. Because I can, yes, I can see actually, like experience, like, why this is happening. For example, there is like people, like people draw paint, like they draw pictures, but also they build different statues. For example, there's one in Goma that you have, like, all the all those artworks that made by rubbish. So how does those thoughts kind of come up with the actual art? So, like, the whole process. I want to see the whole process, but by just seeing the test doesn't really help me understand the whole process. But if I can be immersed into an environment where the art actually creates art during the process that will be amazing. Okay.
