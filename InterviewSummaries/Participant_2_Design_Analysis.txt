Participant 2 — Design Analysis

AUDIENCE / USERS
- Modern art gallery visitors who experience varied emotional responses (empathy vs. alienation).
- Often attend with companions; seek both personal meaning and social validation.

PROBLEM SPACE
- Emotion is unevenly triggered: narrative/atmosphere (e.g., exhibition on Aboriginal suffering) evokes empathy; abstract works feel inaccessible.
- Social sharing is ad hoc: overhearing or post-visit vlogs; little structured in‑situ sharing.
- Feelings stay private; opportunities for collective reflection are missed.

DESIGN GAPS
1) Lack of synchronous emotional sharing
   - In-gallery tools don’t let visitors sense each other’s changing emotions in real time.
2) Bridge to abstract art
   - No mechanism to reframe “I don’t get it” into curiosity via others’ perspectives/emotions.
3) Contextual scaffolding
   - Emotional resonance depends on exhibition design; there’s no dynamic, visitor-driven layer.

CORE GAP
How might we transform internal, often-isolated emotions into shared, situated, and co-created expressions inside galleries?

DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES
1) Emotion-to-media transformation
   - Use AI/AR/music to convert feelings into shareable artifacts (e.g., affect-driven AR visuals) anchored to artworks.
2) Synchronous emotion sharing
   - Biofeedback-driven experiences (heart-rate wearables, group “pulse” visualizations) for real-time resonance.
3) Social validation & collective meaning
   - Lightweight ways to capture/see diverse reactions in situ to reduce alienation with abstract works.
4) Curiosity pathways
   - Prompt re-interpretation of difficult pieces via co-created music, emotional overlays, or narrative snippets.
